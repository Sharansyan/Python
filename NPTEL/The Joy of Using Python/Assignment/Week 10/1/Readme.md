# Programming Assignment-1: Digit

**Due on 2020-04-09, 23:59 IST**

You are provided with a number  **D**  containing only digits 0&#39;s and 1&#39;s. Your aim is to convert this number to have all the digits same.
 For that, you will change exactly one digit i.e. from  **0 to 1**  or from  **1 to 0**. If it is possible to make all digits equal (either all 0&#39;s or all 1&#39;s) by flipping exactly 1 digit then output &quot;YES&quot;, else print &quot;NO&quot; (quotes for clarity).

Input Format:
The first line of the input contains the number  **D**  made of only digits 1&#39;s and 0&#39;s.

Output:
Print &#39;YES&#39; or &#39;NO&#39; depending on whether its possible to make it all 0s or 1s or not.

Example-1:

Input:
101

Output:
YES

Example-2:

Input:
11

Output:
NO

Explanation:
In the first example, it is possible to make all the digits same by flipping the middle digit from 0 to 1. In the second example it is not possible.
