# Programming Assignment-3: Semi Primes
**Due on 2020-03-05, 23:59 IST**
A semiprime number is an integer which can be expressed as a product of two distinct primes. For example 15 = 3\*5 is a semiprime number but 9 = 3\*3 is not .
Given an integer number N, find whether it can be expressed as a sum of two semi-primes or not (not necessarily distinct).
**Input Format:**
The first line contains an integer N.

**Output Format:**
Print &#39;Yes&#39; if it is possible to represent N as a sum of two semiprimes &#39;No&#39; otherwise.

Example:
Input:
30

Output:
Yes

Explanation:
N = 30 can be expressed as 15+15 where 15 is a semi-prime number (5\*3 = 15)
NOTE: N is less than equal to 200
